Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows computer systems to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in large datasets, build predictive models, and make decisions or generate content. Key types of ML include supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through rewards and penalties). Common applications include recommendation systems, fraud detection, and automated customer service.
