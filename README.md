## **Problem Definition**
Academic researchers, students, and writers often face the challenge of creating unique variations of their content while maintaining technical accuracy and academic integrity. Manual paraphrasing is time-consuming, prone to inconsistency, and may unintentionally retain plagiarism risks. Existing tools either produce low-quality output or lack the sophistication required for research-level content.

## **Project Objective**

To develop an advanced AI-powered paraphrasing system specifically designed for research papers and academic content. The solution leverages multiple AI approaches—from simple synonym replacement to advanced transformer models and GPT-4 integration—to generate high-quality, plagiarism-free paraphrased content while preserving technical accuracy and academic tone.
